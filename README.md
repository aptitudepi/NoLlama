# NoLlama

**Local LLM server for the full Intel stack.** NPU, ARC iGPU, ARC discrete, CPU.
OpenAI + Ollama APIs. One server, every Intel device.

No NVIDIA required. No Ollama install. No llama.cpp. **No problem.**

Runs on Intel Core Ultra laptops (NPU + ARC iGPU), desktops with ARC
discrete GPUs (A770, B580), or any Intel CPU. Automatically detects your
hardware, picks the best device, and exposes both OpenAI and Ollama
compatible APIs — so any client that speaks to either just works.

**It drives coding agents, too.** VS Code Copilot Chat and OpenClaw run against
NoLlama with local **tool-calling** on your Intel GPU or CPU — no cloud, no
NVIDIA. See [Agent tools & coding assistants](#agent-tools--coding-assistants-vs-code-copilot-openclaw).

![NoLlama in action](docs/images/nollama-demo.gif)

## Quick start

```powershell
.\install.ps1
.\start.ps1
```

That's it. `install.ps1` detects your hardware, lets you pick a model,
downloads it, and generates `start.ps1`. The launcher waits for the
model to load (with a progress indicator), then opens the built-in
chat UI in your browser at http://localhost:8000.

## Recommended models

New here, or re-running `install.ps1`? Pick a **use-case** in the menu — here are
the proven models per role on a Core Ultra laptop (NPU + ARC iGPU):

| Use-case | Role | Pick in the menu | HuggingFace | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chat | **NPU chat** | Qwen3 8B (INT4-CW) | `OpenVINO/Qwen3-8B-int4-cw-ov` | ~5 GB |
| Vision | **GPU vision** | Qwen3-VL 8B (INT8) | `OpenVINO/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-int8-ov` | ~9 GB |
| Coding agent | **GPU/CPU coder** | Qwen2.5-Coder 7B (INT4) | `OpenVINO/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct-int4-ov` | ~5 GB |

Qwen3 8B is the best-quality text model verified on the NPU. Qwen3-VL 8B
is the matching vision model — the INT8 build keeps fine detail (OCR,
small numbers) and fits a 16 GB ARC; drop to the ~6 GB INT4 build
(`…-int4-ov`) if you're tight on VRAM. For **coding agents** (VS Code Copilot
Chat, OpenClaw), pick the "Coding agent" use-case and a **Qwen2.5-Coder** model —
7B for snappy turns, 14B for stronger multi-step work; it runs on the GPU, or on
the CPU (which beats a weak iGPU on strong desktops). All are pre-exported — **no
conversion step**, though the multi-GB download still takes a while — and returning
users see them flagged **"Already on disk"** (those link instantly).

## What it does

- **OpenAI API** (`/v1/chat/completions`) — works with any OpenAI client, OpenWebUI, etc.
- **Ollama API** (`/api/chat`, `/api/generate`) — works with Ollama clients, OpenWebUI Ollama mode, etc.
- **Auto-detects** NPU, ARC iGPU, ARC discrete, CPU — picks the best available
- **VLM support** — send images via base64 or `file://` URIs for vision models
- **Streaming** — token-by-token for text chat, with collapsible thinking blocks
- **Dual device** — NPU for chat + GPU for vision, simultaneously
- **Tool calling / agents** (GPU/iGPU + CPU, not NPU) — works with VS Code Copilot Chat and OpenClaw; the model drives tools on the ARC GPU or a strong CPU
- **Prefix caching** (on by default) — a repeated prompt prefix (e.g. an agent's fixed system prompt) is prefilled once, not every turn — ~47× faster on cached turns
- **Built-in web UI** — chat, image drop zone, model selector, dark theme
- **Model menu** — curated list of verified models, no conversion nightmares

## Web UI

The server includes a built-in chat interface at http://localhost:8000.
No separate install, no Docker, no Node.js.

![NoLlama chat UI](docs/images/nollama-chat.gif)

A native Windows GUI is planned to replace the browser-based UI.

Features:
- Streaming chat with tokens appearing in real-time
- Collapsible "Thinking..." blocks (Qwen3 reasoning models)
- Drag-and-drop / paste images for VLM queries
- Model selector showing loaded models and their devices
- Device badge on each response (`[NPU 1.2s]`, `[GPU 2.8s]`)
- Dark theme
- Keyboard shortcuts: Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline,
  Ctrl+V to paste images, Ctrl+N for new chat, Escape to cancel

## Device support

| Device | Examples | What it does | Streaming? |
|---|---|---|---|
| NPU (Intel AI Boost) | Core Ultra 7 258V | Text chat via LLMPipeline. Low power, sustained workload sweet spot. | Yes |
| ARC iGPU | ARC 140V (Core Ultra) | Vision + text, or bigger LLM | Yes (VLM streams in 2026.1+) |
| ARC discrete | A770, B580 | Same as iGPU, more VRAM for larger models | Yes (VLM streams in 2026.1+) |
| CPU | Any Intel CPU | Fallback for everything. On desktops with DDR5 and many cores, often *faster* than NPU — see benchmarks. | Yes |

### Intel only — by design

NoLlama is Intel-hardware-only and will stay that way. Non-Intel GPUs
(NVIDIA, AMD) are filtered out of device detection on purpose, even
though OpenVINO 2026 now ships an experimental NVIDIA plugin via
[`openvino-extensibility`](https://docs.openvino.ai/2026/documentation/openvino-extensibility/openvino-plugin-library/plugin.html).
That path drags CUDA/cuDNN into the stack — it's a developer-backend
extension, not a drop-in user feature, and it loses every reason
NoLlama exists in the first place (NPU-first, Intel-first, no CUDA).

If you have an NVIDIA GPU, **use Ollama**. Ollama will always do
Ollama better than NoLlama could, and that's the right tool for that
hardware. NoLlama's value is specifically the Intel NPU / ARC story
that Ollama doesn't tell.

### Benchmark (Core Ultra 7 258V, ARC 140V 16 GB) — laptop, LPDDR5X

Tested with `benchmark.py` — 1 warmup + 5 runs, outliers discarded.

```powershell
# Text-only (no images required)
python benchmark.py --llm-only

# With VLM tests — provide 4 images: two "same vehicle" + two "different"
python benchmark.py --images-dir C:\path\to\images
python benchmark.py --same-1 a.jpg --same-2 b.jpg --diff-1 c.jpg --diff-2 d.jpg
```

**LLM text (Qwen3 8B INT4-CW, same model on NPU and CPU):**

| Test | NPU | CPU |
|---|---|---|
| "Say hello" (thinking) | 11.7s, 5.2 tok/s | 8.1s, 7.4 tok/s |
| "Say hello" (no-think) | 10.6s, 4.6 tok/s | 8.6s, 7.3 tok/s |
| "What is 2+2?" (thinking) | 11.7s, 5.3 tok/s | 9.0s, 7.0 tok/s |
| "What is 2+2?" (no-think) | 5.5s, 0.7 tok/s | 2.7s, 1.5 tok/s |

**GPU (Qwen2.5-VL 3B on ARC 140V, non-streaming):**

| Test | Time |
|---|---|
| "Say hello" (thinking) | 2.6s |
| "Say hello" (no-think) | 2.6s |
| "What is 2+2?" (thinking) | 2.6s |
| "What is 2+2?" (no-think) | 2.4s |
| Same vehicle? (2 images) | 3.8s |
| Different vehicles? (2 images) | 3.8s |

Above benchmarks were captured before VLMPipeline gained streaming
support (openvino-genai 2026.1). VLM now streams on Arc 140V at
roughly 11 tok/s decode after prefill — see
`benchmark.py --backend vlm` for fresh numbers.

CPU beats NPU on throughput (~7.4 vs ~5.2 tok/s) for this model.
GPU text is fast but runs a smaller 3B model (not directly comparable).
VLM image responses take ~3-4s regardless of answer length.

### NoLlama vs Ollama on the Arc 140V iGPU

Ollama now runs on Intel iGPUs via its Vulkan backend, so this is the
direct apples-to-apples question: **same Qwen3-8B, same 4-bit, same
Arc 140V iGPU.** Measured 2026-06-16 with `benchmark.py` (3 runs), using
the `count 1-100` test as the steady-state decode metric.

| | NoLlama (OpenVINO INT4-CW) | Ollama 0.30.8 (Vulkan GGUF Q4) |
|---|---|---|
| **Decode tok/s** (count 1-100) | **21.7** | 13.4 |
| Decode tok/s (2+2, thinking) | 18.6 | 11.2 |
| TTFT (prefill) | 3.2s | **1.85s** |

**NoLlama's OpenVINO GPU path is ~1.6× faster on decode**; Ollama wins
time-to-first-token. Two caveats that matter in practice:

- **Ollama drops the iGPU by default** — it needs `OLLAMA_IGPU_ENABLE=1`,
  or it silently runs on CPU. The out-of-the-box Ollama experience on
  this laptop is *CPU*, not GPU.
- Ollama can't use the **NPU** at all, and has no local **vision** model
  on Intel — both are NoLlama-only.

> **Roadmap note — GPU/CPU support is provisional.** NoLlama's reason to
> exist is the Intel **NPU** (which Ollama doesn't support). The GPU/CPU
> paths are kept only while OpenVINO is meaningfully faster than Ollama
> there. **As/when Ollama's Intel GPU (and CPU) performance catches up to
> OpenVINO, GPU/CPU support will be removed from NoLlama** and it will
> become NPU-only — at that point Ollama is the better tool for GPU/CPU
> and there's no reason to duplicate it. Today (Ollama ~1.6× slower on
> GPU decode, CPU-by-default), that bar isn't met, so GPU/CPU stay.

### Benchmark (Core Ultra 9 285K, RTX 5090) — desktop, DDR5

Same Qwen3 8B INT4-CW model on every Intel device, plus the same model
served via Ollama (GGUF Q4_K_M) on the RTX 5090 for context. 1 warmup +
3 runs. The "count 1-100" test (`max_tokens=4096`, no-think) is the
cleanest cross-stack number — long output, steady-state, no thinking confound.

```powershell
# Each NoLlama device — restart the server with --device <name> first
python benchmark.py --label npu --runs 3 --llm-only
python benchmark.py --label igpu --runs 3 --llm-only
python benchmark.py --label cpu --runs 3 --llm-only

# Ollama (any backend it's running on — CUDA, ROCm, CPU)
python benchmark.py --backend ollama --model qwen3:8b --label rtx5090 --runs 3 --llm-only
```

**Decode throughput, count-1-100 test:**

| Backend | Device | TTFT | Decode tok/s | Speed vs CPU |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ollama (GGUF/CUDA) | RTX 5090 | 0.19s | 197 | 11.1× |
| NoLlama (OpenVINO) | CPU (8P + 16E @ DDR5) | 3.84s | 17.8 | 1.0× |
| NoLlama (OpenVINO) | iGPU (Xe-LPG, 4 cores) | 4.01s | 15.4 | 0.87× |
| NoLlama (OpenVINO) | NPU 3 (Intel AI Boost) | 10.6s | 10.0 | 0.56× |

**Surprises on this hardware:**

- **CPU beats iGPU.** Arrow Lake's 285K (8P + 16E at high clocks) plus
  OpenVINO's tuned INT4 CPU kernels add up to more decode throughput
  than the small Xe-LPG iGPU (only 4 Xe cores on the desktop part —
  the laptop's ARC 140V has 8). Both share the same DDR5 pool, so the
  iGPU has no bandwidth advantage, only a compute disadvantage.
- **NPU is the slowest Intel device on desktop**, opposite of the laptop
  story. NPU's value is power efficiency (laptop on battery), not
  throughput on mains.
- **Prefill scales differently than decode.** RTX 5090's TTFT advantage
  over NPU is ~55× (0.19s vs 10.6s); its decode advantage is ~20×.
  Long prompts amplify the gap.
- **The dGPU dominates** — if you have one, use it. NoLlama's CPU
  fallback is good for "Intel-only laptop on battery", not for
  competing with a discrete card.

**Why the desktop iGPU/NPU are slower than the laptop's:**
LPDDR5X-8533 (laptop, ~136 GB/s) vs DDR5-6400 dual-channel (desktop,
~100 GB/s). Decode throughput on INT4 LLMs is memory-bandwidth-bound,
so the laptop's faster system memory closes some of the gap that
silicon size alone would suggest. (The Core Ultra 7 258V Lunar Lake
NPU also has more compute units than the 285K Arrow Lake NPU.)

**Practical guidance:**

| Hardware | Best NoLlama device |
|---|---|
| Intel Core Ultra laptop (Lunar Lake) | NPU (efficiency) or ARC 140V iGPU |
| Intel Arrow Lake desktop, no dGPU | **CPU** — surprisingly best |
| Intel + ARC discrete (A770, B580) | ARC discrete |
| Intel + NVIDIA discrete | Use Ollama for the dGPU; NoLlama on CPU/NPU/iGPU as fallback |

### Dual mode (NPU + GPU)

When you have both, text requests go to the NPU (streaming) and image
requests go to the GPU (VLM). Or put a bigger LLM on the GPU for
smarter chat. The routing is automatic — send a request and the right
device handles it.

```
POST /v1/chat/completions
  "What is the capital of Norway?"  --> NPU (streaming)
  [image + "What vehicle is this?"] --> GPU (VLM)
```

## Why not OpenVINO Model Server (OVMS)?

Intel already ships OVMS — a production-grade OpenVINO inference server.
If you're deploying LLMs in a datacenter or on Kubernetes, use OVMS.
NoLlama is a different target: your laptop.

| | OVMS | NoLlama |
|---|---|---|
| Target | Production, datacenter, K8s | Laptop, desktop, local |
| Runtime | C++ | Python (Flask) |
| OpenAI API | Yes (recent versions) | Yes |
| Ollama API | No | **Yes** |
| Built-in web UI | No (add OpenWebUI) | **Yes** |
| Auto device detection | No | **Yes** |
| Dual-device routing | One model per instance | **NPU chat + GPU vision, simultaneously** |
| Config | JSON, manual | Zero — `install.ps1` and go |

OVMS is a proper inference server. NoLlama is the thing that makes
your Core Ultra feel like Ollama already ran on it.

## Usage

```powershell
# Auto-detect (picks best device)
python nollama.py

# Force a specific device
python nollama.py --device NPU
python nollama.py --device GPU
python nollama.py --device CPU

# Dual mode: NPU chat + GPU vision
python nollama.py --model-dir model --gpu-model-dir gpu-model

# Different port
python nollama.py --port 9000

# Change the default idle-unload timeout (default is 1800 = 30 min)
python nollama.py --idle-timeout 600     # unload after 10 min idle
python nollama.py --idle-timeout 0       # never unload — keep models loaded forever

# Log every inbound API request (method, path, User-Agent, body) — handy when
# wiring up a new agent client and you need to see exactly what it sends
python nollama.py --debug

# Report a real Ollama version on /api/version so VS Code's Ollama client
# accepts the server (needed for VS Code Copilot Chat in Ollama mode)
python nollama.py --vscode-compat

# Prefix (KV) caching is ON by default for GPU/CPU LLM slots — a repeated prompt
# prefix is prefilled once, not every turn (big win for agent loops, ~47x on a
# cached turn). Tune the pool size, or disable it:
python nollama.py --cache-size-gb 4     # larger KV-cache pool (default 2 GB)
python nollama.py --no-prompt-cache     # disable prefix caching

# Pre-warm the cache at startup so the FIRST agent turn is fast too (not just
# turn 2+). The file auto-populates from the first big prompt served, so the
# workflow is: run once, then restart with --prewarm to skip the cold prefill.
python nollama.py --prewarm prewarm.json
```

### Idle unload

NoLlama frees model memory after **30 minutes of inactivity by default**
(an 8B INT4 model holds ~5 GB of RAM; a VLM another ~3 GB). The next
request automatically reloads the model — the client just sees a slow
first response (~30-60s for an 8B model on NPU). The web UI shows
"Reloading model..." while it waits.

Change with `--idle-timeout <seconds>`. Use `0` to keep models loaded
forever (the old behavior).

`/health` reports `idle_unloaded` slots; the overall status stays
`ready` because requests can still be served (with a reload).

## API

Standard OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions`. Works with any OpenAI client.

### Text chat

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'
```

### Image (VLM, requires GPU with vision model)

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages":[{"role":"user","content":[
      {"type":"text","text":"What is in this image?"},
      {"type":"image_url","image_url":{"url":"data:image/jpeg;base64,..."}}
    ]}]
  }'
```

### Local file shortcut

When client and server are on the same machine, skip base64:

```python
{"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "file:///C:/path/to/image.jpg"}}
```

**Note:** `file://` URIs only work locally. Remote clients must use base64.

### Streaming

```bash
curl -N http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Tell me a story"}],"stream":true}'
```

### Other endpoints

- `GET /health` — device status, model names, readiness
- `GET /v1/models` — list loaded models (OpenAI format)

### Response headers

Every response includes `X-Device` and `X-Model` headers so you can
see which device handled it:

```
X-Device: NPU
X-Model: qwen3-8b
```

## Using with the openai Python package

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="unused")
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="qwen3-8b",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    stream=True,
)
for chunk in resp:
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="")
```

## Ollama API

NoLlama also serves a full Ollama-compatible API on port 11434 (the
Ollama default). Any tool or client that talks to Ollama works without
modification — it thinks it's talking to a real Ollama instance.

Supported endpoints:

- `POST /api/chat` — chat with streaming (newline-delimited JSON)
- `POST /api/generate` — single-turn completion
- `GET /api/tags` — list models
- `POST /api/show` — model info

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat \
  -d '{"model":"qwen3-8b-int4-cw","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'
```

Disable with `--ollama-port 0` if you don't need it or port 11434 is taken.

## Using with OpenWebUI

OpenWebUI can connect via either API:

**OpenAI mode** (recommended):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Base URL | `http://host.docker.internal:8000/v1` |
| API Key | `not-needed` |

**Ollama mode** (no config needed if NoLlama runs on default port):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Ollama Base URL | `http://host.docker.internal:11434` |

## Agent tools & coding assistants (VS Code Copilot, OpenClaw)

NoLlama can drive tool-calling coding agents — the model emits function calls,
NoLlama parses them into OpenAI/Ollama `tool_calls`, and the agent acts on the
results.

> **Tool calling runs on GPU/iGPU and CPU — not the NPU.** The NPU has a hard
> prompt cap and small NPU-class models can't reliably drive agent loops, so
> NoLlama ignores `tools` there and answers as plain chat; `/api/show` advertises
> the `tools` capability only for GPU/CPU slots. Load a coder LLM on the GPU, or
> on a strong desktop CPU (many-core Core Ultra) where prefill can beat a weak
> iGPU. The Qwen2.5-Coder GPU builds in the menu work well; pick a smaller size
> (7B) for snappier prefill on big agent prompts.
>
> Tool turns are **buffered** (the whole reply is generated before the structured
> `tool_calls` are sent), but the server emits SSE keep-alive pings during a long
> prefill so agent clients (Copilot/OpenClaw) don't hit their idle timeout and
> abort. Big agent system prompts (~20k tokens) prefill slowly on weak iGPUs — a
> smaller model, the CPU, or trimming the client's tool set all help. And
> **prefix caching is on by default**, so that big system prompt is prefilled
> once, not every turn — after the first turn, agent turns are fast (~47x on the
> cached prefix). Disable with `--no-prompt-cache`.

The tool prompt is rendered in Qwen3-Coder native format, and `parse_tool_calls`
also understands Hermes, Mistral `[TOOL_CALLS]`, Llama `<|python_tag|>`, DeepSeek,
and bare-JSON outputs — so most instruct/coder models work.

**VS Code Copilot Chat** (0.53+) — point it at the Ollama API and start the
server with `--vscode-compat` so VS Code accepts the version handshake:

```powershell
python nollama.py --gpu-model-dir gpu-coder-model --vscode-compat
```

Then in VS Code set the Ollama base URL to `http://localhost:11434` and pick the
GPU model. (Add `--debug` while wiring it up to see exactly what Copilot sends.)

**OpenClaw** — speaks the OpenAI chat-completions API NoLlama already serves; it
runs against a NoLlama GPU slot with no code changes, just config. See
[OPENCLAW-PLAN.md](OPENCLAW-PLAN.md) for the step-by-step setup (the one gotcha:
address the model as `<name>@GPU` so tool requests hit the GPU, not the NPU).

**Install OpenClaw** (once):

```powershell
npm install -g openclaw@latest
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

Then **`start-openclaw.ps1`** is the one-command launcher (the NoLlama equivalent
of `ollama launch openclaw`):

```powershell
./start-openclaw.ps1 -Setup -Device GPU     # -Setup writes the `nollama` provider into openclaw.json
./start-openclaw.ps1 -Device GPU            # subsequent runs
```

It starts NoLlama with the agent flags (`--device`, `--prewarm`, keep-loaded),
waits until ready, then runs OpenClaw. If a NoLlama is **already** on the port it
**verifies** it (prefix caching on + a tool-capable GPU/CPU slot) and reuses it —
or, if it's misconfigured, tells you why and offers to restart it correctly
(`-Force` to skip the prompt). `-Warmup` fires one throwaway turn first so even
the first real turn is fast.

> **NoLlama runs OpenClaw in a deliberately constrained mode — by design.** A
> coding-agent prompt is large (~21k tokens of system prompt + tool schemas), which
> is a lot for a small local model on weak Intel hardware. So `-Setup` doesn't just
> point OpenClaw at NoLlama — it also **trims OpenClaw** to fit: it selects the
> `coding` tool profile and turns off web search, X search, memory search, and the
> startup-context prelude. This shrinks the prompt and tool surface so a 7B coder on
> an iGPU/CPU can actually drive the loop. It's all plain config in
> `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` — re-enable anything if your hardware can handle a
> bigger prompt, and re-run `-Setup` to restore the trimmed defaults. Package
> updates (`npm i -g openclaw@latest`) don't touch this config; only re-running
> `openclaw onboard` might, in which case re-run `-Setup`.

## Models

`install.ps1` shows a curated menu of models known to work on Intel
hardware. All pre-exported models are download-only (no conversion).
The menu is defined in `models.json` — add entries when new models
are verified.

### Gated or private models (HuggingFace token)

The curated `OpenVINO/…` models are public and download anonymously — no
token needed. You only need a [HuggingFace
token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) (the `hf_…` string) for
**gated** models (ones that make you accept a license, e.g. Llama) or
**private** repos. Pass it with `-HfToken`:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -HfToken hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Note: `hf auth login` won't help on a first run — `install.ps1` is what
installs the `hf` CLI in the first place, so there's no `hf` to log in
with yet. `-HfToken` works on a clean machine because it sets `HF_TOKEN`
before the download (which `huggingface_hub` reads automatically). If you
already have an `hf auth login` token stored from elsewhere, that's used
too — `-HfToken` is just the bootstrap-proof way.

### Adding models outside the menu

Use `download-model.ps1` to grab any HuggingFace model:

```powershell
# Pre-exported OpenVINO model (just download)
.\download-model.ps1 OpenVINO/Qwen3-8B-int4-cw-ov

# Convert a HuggingFace model to OpenVINO
.\download-model.ps1 Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct --convert --weight int8

# With trust-remote-code (some models require this)
.\download-model.ps1 Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct --convert --weight int4 --trust
```

Models download to `~/models/<name>/`. Point NoLlama at them:

```powershell
python nollama.py --model-dir ~/models/my-model --device GPU
python nollama.py --gpu-model-dir ~/models/my-vlm
```

### Finding newer/better models

The model menus rot fast — new architectures appear monthly. The
authoritative place to look is the OpenVINO org on HuggingFace:

**[huggingface.co/OpenVINO](https://huggingface.co/OpenVINO)**

These are pre-exported by Intel, so there's **no conversion step** — just a
download (still slow for multi-GB models, but no 5-20 min `optimum-cli` export).
What to look for:

| Suffix | Where it runs | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `-int4-cw-ov` | NPU + GPU | Channel-wise INT4. NPU's preferred format. |
| `-int4-ov` | GPU only | Standard INT4. Not always NPU-compatible. |
| `-int8-ov` | GPU + CPU | Better fine-detail retention than INT4 (OCR, numbers). |
| `-fp16-ov` | GPU + CPU | Full precision. Largest, slowest, sharpest. |

Quick rules of thumb:
- **NPU chat:** must be `-int4-cw-ov` and ≤ ~10 GB.
- **GPU vision (VLM):** any `-int4-ov` or `-int8-ov` model marked
  "Image-Text-to-Text" on HF.
- **GPU LLM (smarter than NPU):** any `-int4-ov` model up to your
  VRAM. Above ~16 GB falls back to CPU silently.
- **Whisper (STT):** OpenVINO ships pre-quantized whisper variants
  (`whisper-{tiny,base,small,medium,large-v3}-{int4,int8,fp16}-ov`).

Once a model proves itself, add it to `models.json` so it appears in
the install menu. Keep "Untested" tags on entries that haven't been

## How it works

The server auto-detects your model type (VLM or LLM) from
`config.json` and loads the right OpenVINO GenAI pipeline:

- **VLMPipeline** for vision models — handles images + text
- **LLMPipeline** for text models — handles chat with streaming

In dual mode, both pipelines run on separate devices with separate
locks. They don't interfere with each other.

> **Future simplification:** OpenVINO GenAI may unify VLMPipeline and
> LLMPipeline into a single pipeline that handles both text and images.
> When that lands, the dual-pipeline detection and routing logic in
> NoLlama can be collapsed into one code path.

## Requirements

- PowerShell 7+ (Windows PowerShell 5.1 is not supported; on Linux,
  see [Microsoft's install
  instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux))
- Python 3.10+
- OpenVINO 2026.1+ with openvino-genai
- At least one of:
  - Intel Core Ultra (NPU + ARC iGPU)
  - Intel ARC discrete GPU (A770, B580, etc.)
  - Any Intel CPU (slower, but works)
- ~1-17 GB disk per model

`install.ps1` handles the venv, dependencies, and model download.
**There is no `install.sh`** — `install.ps1` *is* the cross-platform
installer, and **Linux users must use it too** (there is no Bash
alternative). On Linux/macOS run it with PowerShell 7
(`pwsh ./install.ps1`, including flags like `-HfToken`); paths and link
creation branch on `$IsWindows`. Windows is the primary platform, but
**Linux is confirmed working** by user reports (Core Ultra 7 258V, NPU +
GPU detected — see [#6](https://github.com/aweussom/NoLlama/issues/6));
macOS is untested. On Linux, NPU and GPU detection needs the Intel
userspace drivers installed (`intel-npu-driver` for the NPU, the GPU
compute runtime for the iGPU) — without them only the CPU shows up. The
NPU Linux stack is less battle-tested than Windows.

## Known limitations

These are known and intentionally not fixed — either because the cause
is upstream, the fix would hurt simplicity, or it doesn't matter for a
local single-user tool.

- **Cancel may not interrupt mid-generation.** The cancel endpoint
  signals OpenVINO's streamer callback to stop. If OpenVINO is blocked
  inside a native call and not invoking the callback, there's no way
  to interrupt it from Python. Generation completes; lock releases
  when it does.
- **NPU prompt limit is 4096 tokens.** Long chat histories will
  eventually exceed this. The UI doesn't trim history — use Ctrl+N to
  start fresh if you hit the limit.
- **Vision runs on the GPU, not the NPU — by design.** The NPU *can*
  load a VLM (Qwen2.5-VL-3B compiles and runs via VLMPipeline; Qwen3.5
  and MiniCPM-V don't compile at all), but the NPU caps the prompt at
  ~1024 tokens *including image tokens*, and Qwen2.5-VL spends one token
  per 28×28 px. That leaves a usable ceiling around **768×768 (~784
  image tokens)**: at that size — or smaller — it answers correctly, so
  NPU vision works **well-ish on very small images** (a 256–512px crop is
  fine). But prefill already takes ~17s at the ceiling, and a plain
  1024×768 photo overflows the cap and fails outright (720p/1080p never
  stand a chance). So vision stays on the GPU, which has no such cap,
  runs at full resolution, and is faster. Measured with
  `test_npu_vlm_imagesize.py`.
- **Ollama management endpoints are stubs.** `/api/pull`, `/api/delete`,
  `/api/copy` return success but don't do anything. Model management is
  via `install.ps1` or `download-model.ps1`, not the API.
- **No graceful shutdown.** Ctrl+C is abrupt. If you hit it mid-load,
  NPU/GPU resources may not free cleanly — usually resolves on next
  launch, occasionally needs a reboot.
- **Flask dev server, not production.** Single-user local tool. Don't
  put it on the internet without a reverse proxy.

## A note about small models

During initial NPU testing with DeepSeek R1 1.5B, we asked:
"What is the capital of Norway?"

The model's response:

> "I need to figure out the capital of Norway. I know it's a country
> in Norway. I remember that Norway is a small island..."

Norway is, in fact, not a small island.

Or *is* it? To paraphrase the greatest detective of all time, Ford
Fairlane: "...an island in an ocean of diarrhea."

The point: 1.5B parameter models are for testing the plumbing, not
for geography. Use Qwen3-8B or larger for actual chat. The small
models will catch up — they're getting smarter every month.
