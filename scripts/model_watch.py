"""Model watcher — notify when new NoLlama-relevant models appear on Hugging Face.

Polls the Hugging Face Hub for two orgs:
  - OpenVINO  : Intel's pre-exported, ready-to-run models (what NoLlama loads).
  - Qwen      : upstream base models (early heads-up before Intel exports them),
                filtered to the families NoLlama actually wants (Coder / VL / Omni).

Diffs the current relevant set against a committed snapshot (seen_models.json).
New ids are reported; the snapshot is updated so you're not re-pinged. On the
very first run the snapshot is empty, so it just establishes a baseline silently
(no issue) — only genuinely *new* models after that trigger a notification.

No third-party deps (urllib only), so the GitHub Action needs no pip install.

Outputs (for GitHub Actions, via $GITHUB_OUTPUT):
  changed=true   snapshot content changed (commit it back)
  new=true       there are new models worth an issue
Writes the issue title/body to scripts/.watch_title and scripts/.watch_body.md.
